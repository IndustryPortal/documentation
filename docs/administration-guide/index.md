# OntoPortal Administration Guide

This is the official installation and maintenance documentation for {{site.opva_version}}.
You can find
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/administration/general">general information</a> about the {{site.opva}}
and its installation process, including descriptions
of the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/administration/steps">installation steps</a> as well as
<a href="{{site.baseurl}}/administration/ontologies">managing ontologies</a>.

To learn how to use a running {{site.opva}}, please visit the existing
<a href="https://www.bioontology.org/wiki/BioPortal_Help">user documentation for BioPortal</a>,
or the documentation generated at your running appliance(found at `https://{my_appliance_hostname}/documentation`).

The {{site.opva}} is provided by the Stanford Center for Biomedical Informatics Research and the {{site.opa}}.
The documentation for the current release ({{site.release_version}})
focuses on system administration of the Appliance.
In coming months, working with the {{site.opa}},
we will add documentation on how to use the {{site.opva}}.
We will also add information about the {{site.opa}}â€”how
it collaborates to maintain the Appliance and how you can help.

You are welcome to make pull requests for improvements to this documentation,
or to submit your questions to the support list at {{site.support_email}}.
