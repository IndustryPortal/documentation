### Background on technology

This site uses [Just the Docs] for its template.

If [Jekyll] is installed on your computer, you can build and preview the created site *locally*. This lets you test changes before committing them, and avoids waiting for GitHub Pages. And you will be able to deploy your local build to a different platform than GitHub Pages.

See the [How to configure the documentation](configuration), to find key things to know about maintaining and contributing to this documentation
